# OCP Console vs CloudPak Console

OCP Console (OpenShift Web Client) can be used to manage all OpenShift artifacts including queue managers. Queue managers can be managed using the IBM MQ Operator. This allows the form-based creation of QMs and YAML-based editing of QMs. The CP4I Console offers a more comfortable way of managing QMs. See details on all options here: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/9.2?topic=dcqmumo-deploying-queue-manager-onto-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-cluster
