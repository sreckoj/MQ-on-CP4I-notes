The internal DNS is described in the following OpenShift documentation chapter: [DNS Operator in OpenShift Container Platform](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/networking/dns-operator.html) 
This is an interesting blog that talks about the same topic: [DNS Deep Dive in OpenShift 4](https://rcarrata.com/openshift/dns-deep-dive-in-openshift/)

Setting up the external DNS is a part of the OpenShift installation process.
