We have to test/explain three different situations:

1. [Accessing queue manager from the external client](external-client.md)
2. Connectivity between two queue managers running on different OpenShift clusters
3. [Connectivity between two queue managers on the same OpenShift cluster](two-queue-managers-internal.md)
